Prompt:
  Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.
  Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:
  
    - It should ask him what his earth weight is.
    - Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
    - It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
  
  Here is the table of conversion:
  | num | Planet | Relative Gravity |
  |---|---|---|
  |1| Mercury | 0.38 |
  |2| Venus   | 0.91 |
  |3| Mars 	  | 0.38 |
  |4| Jupiter | 2.34 |
  |5| Saturn  | 1.06 |
  |6| Uranus  | 0.92 |
  |7| Neptune | 1.19 |

Prompt:
  Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.

  Write a leap_year.cpp program that:
  
      - Takes a year as input.
      - Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
      - Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
  
  There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:
  
      - If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
      - If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
      - If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
  
  Take some time to research and brainstorm before starting to write the code!
